## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **API Organization**: Comprehensive API route structure reorganization with automatic `/api/v1/` prefixing
- DBCode database management instructions added to GitHub Copilot guidelines for schema migrations and data operations
- Timeline upload API endpoint properly organized in `/api/v1/timeline/upload` structure

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: VS Code Simple Browser memory leak eliminated by replacing complex tank context JavaScript with simple modal-only solution
- Server-side VS Code browser detection and automatic tank context assignment to prevent redirect loops
- Tank context validation system replaced with lightweight `ensure_tank_context()` server-side function
- Overdue management route structure fixed (removed nested route decorators causing Flask syntax errors)
- Memory-safe tank context management without periodic timers or infinite loops
- **API Routes**: All API routes moved to proper `/app/routes/api/` folder with automatic `/api/v1/` prefixing
- Duplicate API routes removed from main route files (`overdue.py`, `home.py`)
- Frontend templates updated to use correct `/api/v1/` URLs for all API calls
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed test implementation files and temporary development artifacts
- **Database Schema**: Missing `overdue_dose_requests` table created to support overdue management functionality
- **UI/UX**: Overdue management page dark theme styling fixed - removed white backgrounds, improved text readability
- **User Experience**: Added comprehensive configuration guide and tooltips explaining overdue handling options

### Changed  
- **BREAKING**: Tank context JavaScript completely rewritten from complex class-based system to simple event-driven modal
- **BREAKING**: All API URLs now use `/api/v1/` prefix instead of `/api/` (overdue, timeline, test-results-data endpoints)
- Tank context routes now use `ensure_tank_context()` instead of `get_current_tank_id()` with redirect logic
- VS Code Simple Browser automatically selects first available tank to prevent user interaction requirements
- Removed periodic API validation calls that were causing memory leaks in embedded browsers
- API route organization follows new GitHub Copilot instruction: "API routes should be placed in `app/routes/api/` folder"

### Removed
- **Test Files**: Cleaned up development test implementations and debugging scripts
  - `debug_scheduler.py` - Scheduler debugging script
  - `test_interpolation.py` - Interpolation testing script  
  - `simple_migration.py` - Simple migration testing script
